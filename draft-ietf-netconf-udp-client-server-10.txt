1.  Introduction

   This document defines two YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] modules with reusable
   groupings for managing UDP clients and UDP servers [RFC768].  These
   modules may be used directly (e.g., define a specific UDP client or
   UDP server) or in conjunction with the configuration defined for
   higher level protocols that depend on UDP.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Adherence to the NMDA

   This document is compliant with the Network Management Datastore
   Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  It does not define any protocol
   accessible nodes that are "config false".

1.3.  Conventions

   Various examples in this document use the XML [W3C.REC-xml-20081126]
   encoding.  Other encodings, such as JSON [RFC8259], could
   alternatively be used.

2.  The "ietf-udp-client" Module

   This section defines a YANG 1.1 module called "ietf-udp-client".
   This YANG module defines the "udp-client" grouping for providing UDP
   clients with remote server information.

   Section 2.1 provides the overview of the YANG module.  An example of
   usage is illustrated in Section 2.2, while Section 2.3 defines the
   YANG module itself.

2.1.  Data Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the features and the grouping
   defined in the "ietf-udp-client" YANG module.

2.1.1.  Features

   The "ietf-udp-client" module defines the following "feature"
   statement:

   Features:
     +-- local-binding

   The diagram above uses syntax that is similar to but not defined in
   [RFC8340].

   This feature indicates that the client supports configuring local
   bindings (i.e., the local address and local port number) for UDP
   clients.

2.1.2.  The "udp-client" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the tree structure
   of the "udp-client" grouping:

   module: ietf-udp-client

     grouping udp-client:
       +-- remote-address    inet:host
       +-- remote-port?      inet:port-number
       +-- local-address?    inet:ip-address {local-binding}?
       +-- local-port?       inet:port-number {local-binding}?

   The description of these parameters is provided below:

   *  The "remote-address", which is mandatory, may be configured as an
      IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a hostname.  The resolved
      address should be compatible with the local address family, if
      also provided.

   *  The "remote-port" is defined with neither a "default" nor a
      "mandatory" statement.  YANG modules using this grouping SHOULD
      refine the grouping with a "default" statement, when the port
      number is well-known (e.g., a port number allocated by IANA), or
      with a "mandatory" statement, if a port number needs to always be
      configured.  This MAY be ignored when the port number is neither
      well-known nor mandatory to configure, such as might be the case
      when this grouping is used by another grouping.

   *  The "local-address", which is enabled by the "local-binding"
      feature, may be configured as an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or
      a wildcard value.  The local address must use the same address
      family as the configured remote address.

   *  The "local-port", which depends on the "local-binding" feature, is
      not mandatory.  Its default value is "0", indicating that the
      operating system can select an arbitrary port number.

2.2.  Example Usage

   This section presents an example of usage of the "udp-client"
   grouping.

   <!-- The outermost element below doesn't exist in the data model. -->
   <!--  It simulates if the "grouping" were a "container" instead.  -->

   <udp-client xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-udp-client">
     <remote-address>www.example.com</remote-address>
     <remote-port>10000</remote-port>
     <local-address>192.0.2.2</local-address>
     <local-port>12345</local-port>
   </udp-client>

3.  The "ietf-udp-server" Module

   This section defines a YANG 1.1 module called "ietf-udp-server".
   This YANG module defines the "udp-server" grouping for managing UDP
   servers.

   Section 3.1 provides an overview of the "ietf-udp-server" YANG
   module.  An example of usage is illustrated in Section 3.2 while
   Section 3.3 defines the YANG module itself.

3.1.  Data Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the grouping defined in the
   "ietf-udp-server" module.

3.1.1.  The "udp-server" Grouping

   The following tree diagram [RFC8340] illustrates the structure of
   "udp-server" grouping:

   module: ietf-udp-server

     grouping udp-server:
       +-- local-bind* [local-address]
          +-- local-address    inet:ip-address
          +-- local-port?      inet:port-number

   The description of these parameters is provided below:

   *  The "local-address", which is mandatory, may be configured as an
      IPv4 address, an IPv6 address, or a wildcard value.

Internet-Draft    Groupings for UDP Clients and Servers    November 2025


   *  The "local-port" is defined with neither a "default" nor a
      "mandatory" statement.  YANG modules using this grouping SHOULD
      refine the grouping with a "default" statement, when the port
      number is well-known (e.g., a port number allocated by IANA), or
      with a "mandatory" statement, if a port number needs to always be
      configured.  This MAY be ignored when the port number is neither
      well-known nor mandatory to configure, such as might be the case
      when this grouping is used by another grouping.

3.2.  Example Usage

   This section presents two examples of usage of the "udp-server"
   grouping.

   This following shows an example of a server configured for listening
   to an IPv4 address:

   <!-- The outermost element below doesn't exist in the data model. -->
   <!--  It simulates if the "grouping" were a "container" instead.  -->

   <udp-server xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-udp-server">
     <local-bind>
       <local-address>192.0.2.2</local-address>
       <local-port>49152</local-port>
     </local-bind>
   </udp-server>

   This following shows an example of a server configured to listen to
   an IPv4 and IPv6 together:

   <!-- The outermost element below doesn't exist in the data model. -->
   <!--  It simulates if the "grouping" were a "container" instead.  -->

   <udp-server xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-udp-server">
     <local-bind>
       <local-address>192.0.2.2</local-address>
       <local-port>49152</local-port>
     </local-bind>
     <local-bind>
       <local-address>2001:db8::0</local-address>
       <local-port>49153</local-port>
     </local-bind>
   </udp-server>

3.3.  YANG Module

   The "ietf-udp-server" imports types defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netmod-rfc6991-bis].

   The "ietf-udp-client" and "ietf-udp-server" YANG modules defines a
   data model that is designed to be accessed via YANG-based management
   protocols, such as NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These
   protocols have to use a secure transport layer (e.g., SSH [RFC6242],
   TLS [RFC8446], and QUIC [RFC9000]) and have to use mutual
   authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   The YANG modules define a set of identities, types, and groupings.
   These nodes are intended to be reused by other YANG modules.  The
   module by itself does not expose any data nodes that are writable,
   data nodes that contain read-only state, or RPCs.  As such, there are
   no additional security issues related to the YANG module that need to
   be considered.

   Modules that use the groupings that are defined in this document
   should identify the corresponding security considerations.  For
   example, reusing some of these groupings will expose privacy-related
   information (e.g., 'remote-address', 'remote-port', 'local-address'
   or 'local-port').

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document describes the URIs from IETF XML Registry and the
   registration of a two new YANG module names

5.1.  URI

   IANA is requested to assign two new URIs from the IETF XML Registry
   [RFC3688]:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-udp-client
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-udp-server
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

5.2.  YANG Module Name

   This document also requests IANA to register the following YANG
   modules in the YANG Module Names registry [RFC6020] within the "YANG
   Parameters" registry group:
